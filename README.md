## Introduce

It's a pokemon list.

#### Pokemon List

- We want to see all the pokemon on the page by default.
- We can search by name every pokemon and you must show every pokemon matched with the searched string.
- Threshold Power field: When you put a value (pokemon power), you must update the count value and count every pokemon with the power threshold. Example: if you put 319, you must return every pokemon with power strictly above 319.
- Count: must show the current count of pokemon returned by your search input and/or power threshold.
- Min: you must return the minium pokemon power of the list. It must be worked with search
- Max: you must return the maximum pokemon power of the list. It must be worked with search
  Example : [Search part](with-search.png) [Power threshold part](with-threshold.png).

#### Pokemon view

- When you click on a row (pokemon in table), you must show this pokemon in a new page (Page pokemon ex: /pokemon/2344). You must show in this page, all properties of pokemon and this image (available in public/images folder). 
A next button and a previous button must be display to access on previous or next pokemon (based on id logic).


#### Unit test

- Make unit test on components, helpers, endpoint, ...

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[Page list pokemon](http://localhost:3000/) can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/.
[Page pokemon](http://localhost:3000/pokemon/2344) can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/pokemon/2344.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/pokemons](http://localhost:3000/api/pokemons). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/pokemons.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
